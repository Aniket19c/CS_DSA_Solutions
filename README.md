## 🌳 Branching Structure  
This repository follows a structured branching model:  

- **`main` branch** → Contains only the `README.md` and serves as the primary documentation.  
- **`dev` branch** → Contains all solution files and serves as the working branch.  
- **Feature-specific branches** → Each data structure has its own branch under `dev`:  
  - `arrays` → Contains solutions for array-based problems.  
  - `linked-lists` → Contains solutions for linked list problems.  
  - `stacks` → Contains solutions for stack-related problems.  
  - `queues` → Contains queue-based solutions.  
  - `trees` → Contains solutions for tree-related problems.  
  - `graphs` → Contains solutions for graph algorithms.  

To switch between branches, use:  
```sh
git checkout branch-name
