## ðŸŒ³ Branching Structure  
This repository follows a structured branching model:  

- **`main` branch** â†’ Contains only the `README.md` and serves as the primary documentation.  
- **`dev` branch** â†’ Contains all solution files and serves as the working branch.  
- **Feature-specific branches** â†’ Each data structure has its own branch under `dev`:  
  - `Arrays` â†’ Contains solutions for array-based problems.  
  - `Linked-lists` â†’ Contains solutions for linked list problems.  
	 -`Student-Manager` â†’ Implements linked list operations for managing students.
	 -`College_Management_System` â†’ Implements linked list operations for managing College students with department name .
  - `Strings` â†’ Contains solutions for string-related problems.  
  - `Stack-Queue` â†’ Contains solutions for stack-related problems.


To switch between branches, use:
