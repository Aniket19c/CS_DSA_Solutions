## ðŸŒ³ Branching Structure  
This repository follows a structured branching model:  

- **`main` branch** â†’ Contains only the `README.md` and serves as the primary documentation.  
- **`dev` branch** â†’ Contains all solution files and serves as the working branch.  
- **Feature-specific branches** â†’ Each data structure has its own branch under `dev`:  
  - `arrays` â†’ Contains solutions for array-based problems.  
  - `linked-lists` â†’ Contains solutions for linked list problems.  
  - `strings` â†’ Contains solutions for strings-related problems.  


To switch between branches, use:  
```sh
git checkout branch-name
